# Summary of Articles "A Comparison of NoSQL Database Management Systems and Models and Data Lakehouse"


## Article 1: A Comparison of NoSQL Database Management Systems and Models 
This article proposes NoSQL databases as alternatives to conventional relational databases since they can get over constraints like managing unstructured data and having issues in horizontally scaling. Key-value stores, columnar databases, document-oriented databases, and graph databases are a few examples of the different models that comprise NoSQL databases. Columnar databases store data in columns for quick query processing, while key-value databases concentrate on effective data retrieval through associative arrays. Document-oriented databases, which are suited for storing a variety of data types, store data as documents with customizable schemas. With an emphasis on the connections between data items, graph databases are well-suited for applications like social networks and fraud detection. The development of database management systems beyond the relational paradigm is marked by the distinctive characteristics of each NoSQL model, which cater to certain use cases.

## Article 2: Data Lakehouse
The idea of a data lakehouse is introduced in the second article from Databricks. A cutting-edge data management architecture called a "data lakehouse" combines the adaptability of data lakes with the organization and transactional capabilities of data warehouses. It incorporates information layers, query engines that are optimized, and accessibility for machine learning and data science. This architecture minimizes the complexity of conventional two-tier data architectures while streamlining data administration and accelerating data-driven projects. Data lakehouses make it possible to store and analyze different forms of data at low costs, promoting flexibility and scalability while integrating data management for business intelligence and machine learning applications.
