# Analyzing Netflix Content: Global Distribution and Trends Using Tableau
This project involved developing a Tableau dashboard to analyze Netflix's global content distribution and identify key trends. The dashboard visualizes data on movie and TV show availability across different countries, popular genres, content ratings, and yearly growth. By integrating key performance metrics (KPIs) such as content distribution percentages and growth rates, the dashboard provides stakeholders with actionable insights into viewer preferences and market expansion. This project demonstrates proficiency in data visualization, KPI integration, and the use of Tableau for impactful data analysis.
